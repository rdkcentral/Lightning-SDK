- Added support for experimental esbuild support
- Router Plugin refactor
  - Breaking changes
    - `page.dynamicRouteProperty = hashValue;` is no longer being set, now use `_onUrlParams(args)`. In the previous release on route: `home/browse/:section` and a `navigate()` to: `home/browse/adventure` the Router would set the page prop `page['section'] = 'adventure'` but this could lead to unwanted and error prone behaviour. This undocumented feature has now been removed.
